          <p class="title">Overview</p>
          <p class="details"><span style="font-weight: 1000;">Fishing for Plastic is a grass roots organization committed to cleaning up the coastlines of the world.  </span>

Our Mission is to empower subsistence fishermen to engage in bringing in waste plastic as part of their catch. </span>

 In exchange for harvested plastic they can receive cash or credits towards the things that they need to survive such as fishing gear, water filtration systems, food and other essentials.  This is a win~win for the environment and the communities that depend on the sea for their families survival. 
        <b>The concept is simple</b> with access to coastal beaches and regions overflowing with ocean plastics fishermen will be compensated for bringing in the plastic waste to collection points, where it will then be recycled.  Monetizing the plastic is the solution to getting it collected from the shorelines of the world.
We will bring the concept of shoreline stewardship to developing countries by empowering the fishermen who live there to become part of the solution.
Our commitment is to have a pilot project underway in the Caribbean basin in the first quarter of 2019.
